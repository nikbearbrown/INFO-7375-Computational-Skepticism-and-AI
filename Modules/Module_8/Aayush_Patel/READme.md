- **Week 9 (10/03/2025)**
- Worked on three agentic-AI topics—(1) design patterns (planning, reflection, tool use, multi-agent), (2) the five agent types + multi-agent systems, and (3) the  Perceive→Reason→Act→Learn loop—and consolidated them into a single Jupyter notebook with concise notes and runnable demos.

- **Week 11 (10/17/2025)**
- Created a Jupyter Notebook covering Topic 6: Real-World Applications of Agentic AI and Topic 7: What Sets Agentic AI Apart.
- Explored practical uses across Customer Service, Content Creation, Software Development, Healthcare, Video Analytics, and Finance, showing how agentic AI drives automation     and efficiency.
- Also summarized the core differentiators — Autonomy, Reasoning Capacity, Multi-Step Problem Solving, Learning & Improvement, and Tool Integration — emphasizing how agentic AI advances beyond traditional AI systems.

- **Week 10 (24/10/2025)**
- Created a Jupyter Notebook on Topic 8: AI Agent Protocols – The Communication Foundation.
- Explained how AI Agent Protocols standardize communication between agents, similar to how HTTP connects web systems. Focused on MCP (Model Context Protocol) by Anthropic—its   purpose, strengths (universal compatibility, real-time data access, secure design, developer-friendly setup), and limitations.
